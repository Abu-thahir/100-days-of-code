### Question

> Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

```
Input: 
Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
```

### Code [python]

```python3

class Solution:
    def findTwoElement( self,A,n): 
        s = (n* (n+ 1)) // 2
        sum_sq = ((n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6)
        missingNumber, repeating = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            s -= A[i]
            sum_sq -= A[i] * A[i]
        missingNumber = (s + sum_sq // s) // 2
        repeating = missingNumber - s
        ans = []
        ans.append(repeating)
        ans.append(missingNumber)
        return ans
        
```
